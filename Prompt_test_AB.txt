Prompt: A/B Test Analysis for Marketing Team

I have an A/B experiment dataset with the following fields:

Cell: Experimental group (control, test_1, test_2)

pageviews: Number of pageviews per group

clicks: Number of clicks per group

online_reservations: Number of online reservations (our success metric)

Hereâ€™s what I need you to do:

Identify the best-performing cell based on the online_reservations metric.

Calculate the lift of the winning cell compared to the others.

Compute the conversion rate for each group: online_reservations / pageviews.

Run a statistical test (difference in proportions, 95% confidence) to determine if the test groups differ significantly from the control.

Recommend the winning cell, with clear reasoning based on statistical evidence.

Explain everything simply and clearly, as if presenting to a non-technical marketing team. Keep it direct, objective, and easy to understand.


dataset in JSON format:

  { "cell": "control", "pageviews": ..., "clicks": ..., "online_reservations": ... },
  { "cell": "test_1", "pageviews": ..., "clicks": ..., "online_reservations": ... },
  { "cell": "test_2", "pageviews": ..., "clicks": ..., "online_reservations": ... }
