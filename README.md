Project Overview: AI Agent for A/B Testing with N8N

In this project, we’ll build an AI agent using N8N, tailored for A/B testing in digital marketing. The process begins with designing a workflow in N8N, configuring each step, and crafting a prompt to guide the agent’s tasks. 
Once executed, the agent will run the full workflow and automatically send the A/B test results to my email.
Each time the agent is triggered, it completes the analysis and delivers clear, actionable insights directly to my inbox.
